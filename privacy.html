                    <p>20 Minutes - Habit Builder ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This
                        Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you
                        use the 20 Minutes - Habit Builder mobile application (the "App"), operated by Giorgi Lutidze
                        (the "Developer").</p>
                    <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this
                        policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

                    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
                    <h4>a. Information You Provide Voluntarily</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Email Address and Account Information:</strong> Email is optional. You can use the
                            App fully without an account. We recommend signing in with email only if you purchase a
                            subscription and want cloud sync of your habits across iOS devices (free users can also sync
                            limited data).<br>
                            We collect your email to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create and authenticate your account</li>
                                <li>Enable cloud sync of your habit data</li>
                                <li>Allow password reset if you forget your password</li>
                            </ul>
                            We may collect your name if you provide it (currently not implemented).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Habit and Usage Data:</strong> Habits you create (e.g., habit name, timer duration,
                            icons), progress (completed sessions, streaks), and related settings are stored primarily on
                            your device. If you choose to sync, this data is uploaded to our backend to enable
                            cross-device access when you sign in again.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>b. Automatically Collected Information</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Device and Technical Data:</strong> Basic information like device type, iOS version,
                            and app version (via Expo framework) for basic functionality and crash prevention (no
                            detailed analytics).</li>
                        <li><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> If you subscribe, Apple handles all payments. We (via
                            RevenueCat) receive purchase history metadata (e.g., subscription status, transaction IDs)
                            to unlock premium features and manage entitlements — we never see your payment card details.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>c. Push Notifications</h4>
                    <p>We request permission for push notifications to send habit reminders and motivational nudges
                        (e.g., if you haven't completed your daily habits). These are based on your in-app activity
                        (completion status) and not used for marketing.</p>
                    <p>We do not collect location, camera, contacts, health data, or any other sensitive information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
                    <p>We use your information only to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide core App functionality (habit tracking, timers, streaks)</li>
                        <li>Enable optional cloud sync across your iOS devices</li>
                        <li>Authenticate logins and process password resets</li>
                        <li>Manage subscriptions and unlock premium features (longer sessions, more habits, colorful
                            themes)</li>
                        <li>Send non-marketing push notifications for reminders</li>
                        <li>Respond to support requests (via email)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, marketing emails, analytics beyond basic
                        operation, or any purpose unrelated to providing the App.</p>

                    <h3>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
                    <p>We use these third-party services (they act as our processors under our instructions):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> For optional account authentication, email storage, and cloud
                            storage/sync of habit data when you choose to sync.</li>
                        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> To manage in-app subscriptions and process purchase
                            entitlements (via Apple's In-App Purchases). RevenueCat collects only transaction metadata —
                            no emails or personal details from end-users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Expo:</strong> Development framework that may handle basic technical data for app
                            performance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the services
                        we provide. We do not share your data with any other third parties.</p>
                    <p>We do not sell your personal information to anyone, for any reason.</p>

                    <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On-device data (habits, progress) is stored locally on your iPhone/iPad.</li>
                        <li>Synced data (if you opt in) is stored securely in Supabase (encrypted in transit and at
                            rest).</li>
                        <li>We implement reasonable security measures, but no system is 100% secure.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>5. Your Rights and Choices</h3>

                            SpeedNeonLabs@gmail.com to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your

                            delay.</li>
                        <li><strong>Opt-Out of Sync:</strong> Simply do not sign in or sync — all features work locally
                            without an account.</li>
                        <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> Disable in iOS Settings > Notifications.</li>
                        <li><strong>GDPR (EU/EEA):</strong> If you are in the EU/EEA, you have rights to access,
                            rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, and object (including to legitimate
                            interest processing). Email us to exercise these.</li>
                        <li><strong>CCPA/CPRA (California):</strong> California residents may request to know what data
                            we collect, delete it, or opt out of "sales" (we do not sell or share data for cross-context
                            behavioral advertising). Email us.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other Rights:</strong> We honor similar rights under other applicable laws.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
                    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from them. If we
                        learn we have collected such data, we will delete it. (COPPA does not apply.)</p>

                    <h3>7. International Transfers</h3>
                    <p>Data may be processed in the United States or other countries (e.g., Supabase servers). We ensure
                        appropriate safeguards for transfers outside the EEA.</p>

                    <h3>8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
                    <p>We may update this policy. Changes will be posted here with an updated Effective Date. Continued
